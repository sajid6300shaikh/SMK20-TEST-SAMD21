/* Total 8 sensors
	Each will have its 32bit ADC value as received from External ADC.(actual ADC result Resolution is signed 17 bits)
	Apart from that these sensors will also have their Zero val(called Lower) and SPAN value(called Upper)
	
	Based on Calibration, sensors can be divided into 2 categories
	1. Sensors with Zeroing capability
	2. Sensors without Zeroing capability
	
1. Sensors with Zeroing Capability (AZSensors): These sensors can be zeroed anytime, hence they have 1 point calibration.(because at zero count of sensor std Min is 0)
	At Power On, the zero value of sensor is read into Zero.Sensor_name and afterwards all sensors readings are subtracted from this zero value.
	Hence while calibration only SPAN value of these sensors is stored and equation to convert their ADC count to physical paramete is Y=MX;
	where, X is currently read(and subtracted from zero) ADCCount, M is SLOPE, Y is corresponding calculated physical parameter (like for orifice_DP it can be 120.8 mmWC)
	and here Slope, M = SensorName.STDUpper/SensorName.ADCUpper;

2. Sensors without Zeroing capability (nAZSensors): These sensors have 2 point calibration
	These sensors can't be zeroed at every power on.
	While Calibration these sensors are subjected to Min STD value(STDLower) as well as Max STD value(STDUpper) and both points are stored in EEPROM along with corresponding ADC counts(ADClower and ADCUpper)
	Equation to convert these sensors ADC value to physical parameter is Y=M*X+C. (Straight line equation in Slope-Intercept form)
	where, X is currently read ADCCount, M is SLOPE, C is intercept, Y is corresponding calculated physical parameter(like for orifice_DP it can be 120.8 mmWC)
	M=(Y2-Y1)/(X2-X1)=(STDUpper-STDLower/ADCUpper-ADCLower).
	Difference, as compared to AZsensors calculation, here is 'C', y-intercept(it is there due to non zero STDLower)
	C=Y2-M*X2= STDUpper - M*ADCUpper.
